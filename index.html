        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 28 year old Augusta native. I graduated from Augusta University in 2013 with a B.A. in Political Science with a concentration
            in International Relations and a minor in Spanish. My passions include: animals, traveling, yoga, design, music, reading, and gardening.

            <h2>What I'm Up To</h2>
             <p>In 2018 I began exploring different career options.  I came across a coding boot camp through
                 Skillcrush, and I enrolled in the front end developer blueprint. <a href="https://www.kaitlyn-alexander.com">Check out my work here.</a>
                 After learning to code online I wanted to further immerse myself in the coding world so I enrolled in the coding boot camp
                 through the Clubhou.se Augusta. My goal is to obtain a job as a full stack developer once I graduate in December 2019.
