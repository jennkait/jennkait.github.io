            <h2>About me</h2>
             <p> I was born and raised in Augusta, GA. After graduating from Augusta University and 
            being in the work force for several years, I discovered my passion for web development.
            I enrolled in an online boot camp and began to code websites and web applications.
            I enrolled in an in-person boot camp in 2019 to furhter immerse myself in the coding world.
            I plan to pursue a career as a full-stack developer once I graduate from the coding boot camp
            in December 2019.
